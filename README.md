This is one of the capstone projects from the Udemy course "100 days of code: The complete Python Pro Bootcamp"

It is a language flashcard app that takes a list of words and their translations from a .csv file. It displays initial word for 3 seconds before flipping to translation automatically. Upon opening, it checks for and creates a new .csv of "words-to-learn". Depending on if the user clicks the checkmark(knew the word) or cross(didn't know the word) it will alter the "words-to-learn" .csv and only display the unknown words.

Included is a list of French words.
